# Refactoring

You've been asked to refactor the function `deterministicPartitionKey` in [`dpk.js`](dpk.js) to make it easier to read and understand without changing its functionality. For this task, you should:

1. Write unit tests to cover the existing functionality and ensure that your refactor doesn't break it. We typically use `jest`, but if you have another library you prefer, feel free to use it.
2. Refactor the function to be as "clean" and "readable" as possible. There are many valid ways to define those words - use your own personal definitions, but be prepared to defend them. Note that we do like to use the latest JS language features when applicable.
3. Write up a brief (~1 paragraph) explanation of why you made the choices you did and why specifically your version is more "readable" than the original.

You will be graded on the exhaustiveness and quality of your unit tests, the depth of your refactor, and the level of insight into your thought process provided by the written explanation.

## Your Explanation Here

I made several changes to the original code to make it more readable:

- I removed the unnecessary let declaration for candidate and initialized it to the trivial partition key.
- I removed the nested if-else block and used a single if-else-if block instead.
- I moved the typeof check to before the candidate is assigned to the trivial partition key to avoid unnecessary stringification.
- I made sure that the MAX_PARTITION_KEY_LENGTH constant is used consistently throughout the function.

I chose these changes because I think they make the code more readable by reducing the number of unnecessary conditional statements and making the logic flow more straightforward. The unit tests cover all possible execution paths of the function to ensure that the refactoring doesn't break any existing functionality.
